# Adfab Gulp Boilerplate

The goal of this [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) boilerplate is to free you time so you can do something more interesting than reinventing the wheel, it includes:

* Automatic reloading of the browser on code modification (using [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/))
* CSS / JS Sourcemaps
* HTML minification
* JS compilation
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transpiler (ES6 support FTW)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) or [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) compilation
* Notifications on success and error
* Fonticon generation
* SVG Sprite generation
* Production mode: JS / CSS minification + sources maps removal

## Installation

```shell
npm install git+ssh://git@github.com:AdFabConnect/adfab-gulp-boilerplate.git#v0.9.2
```

Upon installation, two files will be copied to the root of your project: `gulpfile.js` and `gulp-config.js`.

## Usage

### Enable the tasks you need

Just check `gulpfile.js` out de-comment what you need and comment out what you don't.

### Configure the tasks

Every task rely on the `gulp-config.js` file for their configuration. Just fill-in the values you need.

### Browser live reloads

Start [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/):

```shell
gulp serve
```

It acts as a proxy to the domain you specified in `gulp-config.js` (property `vhost`). You can now access your project by specifying the `3000` port (if you usually access your project via http://project.localhost/, now it would be http://project.localhost:3000/).

You can also test it in production mode by passing the `--production` option. That way, it will remove *sourcemaps* and minify JS and CSS.
